## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git? to keep control of the different versions of our code on our local system. if somehow development gets off track, you can revert to an older commit.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches? this allows for exploring a different direction in your project without compromising your original code.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the versioning system on your local system, GitHub is a robust remote repository where you can show(or not), collaborate, and build a public face for your projects acting as a portfolio to compliment your resume.
