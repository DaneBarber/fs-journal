> **ðŸ“– [Async and Await](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/03-Async-Await)**

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
 - to simplify by use of an abstraction layer and adding the callback, thusly reducing the chaining issues from callbacks.
2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
- you must have the prefix of Async identifying the function that it is Asynchronous and that the function should look for await to cause that part to wait until that promise is fulfilled.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
- simplifies the code(callback hell)
- prevents errors by causing functions to wait until fulfilled, rather than running like its synchronous code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Some functions require patience, and that is what Async and Await help take care of. This opens a whole new level of functionality rather than trying to hack a solution for catching all the errors and doing something with them, there is a methodology within the system to capture and handle them, and having a system for saying "Hey, you have to be patient for this piece of information before you go to the next part, we got you boo!"
