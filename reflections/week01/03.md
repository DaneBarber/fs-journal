## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design? Especially at the beginning part of this learning, repetition and turn it into muscle and brain memory should help bring in those frenetic instincts

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/
https://www.w3schools.com/
https://www.figma.com/

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone? if the navigation through a site is of good design, the effort of navigating and gathering the information they are looking for will convey intelligent, very well thought out, and possibly even outside the box thinking which would give anyone a good feeling about who they may be dealing with.
