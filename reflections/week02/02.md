## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
 - Function Declaration where your call it a function
 - Function Expression is similar to setting a variable by using let, a shorter version of this is using an Arrow Function, it still works the same.


2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
 - Parameters are created when you define your function, where you identify names your function uses,
  - arguments are the values from each parameter, that are provided when invoking the function

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
 - they are functions that a function can receive as a parameter which provides additional functionality.  .map and .filter are a couple of them.
