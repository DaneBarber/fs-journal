## Questions

1. What is Scope ? Scope is where a variable has effect, ie if it has local scope, you cannot access the variable from outside of its container.

2. What is Hoisting ? Hoisting is the javascript process where functions and variables are moved to the top of their scope and are set to undefined

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
let is preferred for variable definition these days, as it fixes a lot of the issues with var, so this would be used in most cases.
const would be used in situations where you would not want your variable updated or re-declared as those operations are not available to const.  ie setting a set of values that you want to keep "constant" through the application or block where it is coped.  var variables could be used if you are in need of a variable to be re-declared
