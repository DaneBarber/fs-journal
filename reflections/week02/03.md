## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style. console.log and console.error, you would use the log to push values to the console so you can see what values are being passed from functions and such, the console.error can give you additional detail where something is going wrong, which will help in your debugging process.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML? that would be the sources tab, if you are running  your debugger, you can see what the state of each variable is by hovering over your variables.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code? utilizing the javascript debugging pane in the devtools and utilizing breakpoints at critical areas.
