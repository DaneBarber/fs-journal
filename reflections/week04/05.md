# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? - a greater appreciation for the usage of APIs, its the cornerstone for database interactions
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise? the shear quantity of APIs out there! Free and Paid. looking into the Ebay one to look for opportunities there.
- What are you struggling with? right now its still event listeners, I find I'm writing work a around, but I'm forcing myself to utilize the functionality that is provided, I'll get it.
- What would you count as a victory? really understanding APIs and what they have to offer, especially the abundance of them, and knowing that there are plenty of solutions, and examples of what to do and what not todo(pain points) to implement or not implement in my future projects.
