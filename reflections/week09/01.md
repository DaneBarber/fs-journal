## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project? Primarily we are using Box Map

2. What went well so far? Once I took the lead on the MapBox and focused on it directly, things started clicking functionality wise, using inspiration from Haunted Highway(thank you) we were able to see some of the functionality we needed/wanted to have in our capstone.

3. What would you do differently? Why? I think we could have benefited from having someone start with working on MapBox so when it came time for adding functionality, the implementation curve would have been shorter. We ended up not coming close to our stretch goals.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
as identified on the previous week's journals, I need to do them right away, as if I don't do them its a scramble, which sometimes it results in them not being done, must improve.
