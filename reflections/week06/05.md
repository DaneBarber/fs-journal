# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- even though this is my second round through this course, yes I feel I have a better grasp on Vue, but I do not like the moments where the brain cannot put the links together and panic sets in. This passes and I'm able to find what I need in the classroom material or a websearch.  I am getting this thing.
