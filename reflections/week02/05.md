# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?functions and datatypes for the most part was review, however there were a number of items that became more clear this time through.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? can't say any surprizes really, just more of a solidification of my current knowledgebase. 
- What are you struggling with?  right now I'm not really struggling with anything, just eager to get on to the next few weeks
- What would you count as a victory? working with Seth, where he was needing more knowledge, I was able to help in some ways solidify some of those for him, the more complex items I encouraged him to talk to an instructor.
