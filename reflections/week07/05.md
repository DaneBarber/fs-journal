# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

- working with someone on project makes you more aware of what you are doing, and what you can do to help the process more. I can see it being more beneficial to do more planning, and providing more detail an advantage to build, as it leaves less questions overall.
