# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?
 - The teamwork aspect of this challenge(Capstone) really shows more about yourself working dynamically with others. Different personalities bring out different aspects/reactions/challenges/successes that truly cause growth and the learning more of oneself.  I really appreciate this chapter of Codeworks.
