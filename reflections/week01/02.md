## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use? a pseudo class I would call a subset property of a class, ie you can have a hover, before, and after property to enable a property/styling while your cursor is hovered, a style before an action, and a style after an action.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit? specificity is a rule system which enables css to determine which properties will have priority upon rendering depending on the content and what is called out to determine this order.  Some items can have such a high specificity it cannot feasibly be overridden

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature? if you misplace the !important, you can easily override stylings that you may have need for in the final product, and this could keep it from being rendered.
