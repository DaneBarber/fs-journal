# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I'm understanding more this time through the class than previously
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? I can't say there was any real surprise, other than Taskmaster not being the Checkpoint :P
- What are you struggling with?can't really say there is much of a struggle currently
- What would you count as a victory?getting as much done as early due to the familiarity with the subject matter.
