# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

asynchronous means it may require time and allows a waiting for that time before working with the data, synchronous is real time, and if you have to wait for an item, you could have errors 
```
**2.** What is an event listener?

**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Open-Closed Principle, where objects should be open for extending, but not open for modification
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to a function, and is executed when the initial function is complete. Higher order functions can be returned, or operate on other functions
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Pending - when waiting for a response
Resolved - for when the response is complete
Rejected - for when the response was not completed
```
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

```
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the call is made in the Service, in our case Axios handles it. 
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
a type of protection, like a black box, the insides are not accessible for manipulation, but will provide/expose some things that are only by design.
```
