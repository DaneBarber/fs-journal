# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?as this is my second time through, the concepts and ideas were more easily absorbed and I was able to get to other elements that maybe I didn't get the first time.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?that there was considerably more to html/css than what I initially thought
- What are you struggling with? right now I would say I'm struggling with holding it all in my head. I really need these journals to keep track of it all, and update them as things change.
- What would you count as a victory?How much more comfortable I was this time around as I definitely had a greater hold on many of the concepts and I wasn't hesitant to ask for help like I was the first time around
