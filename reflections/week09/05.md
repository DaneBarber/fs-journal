# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Working with this team, made this chapter amazing in my story of Codeworks.  What the rest of the team members brought was nothing but positivity, and a willingness to investigate solutions together.  The only ego I saw was a collective ego, there was no negativity, and a lot of bonding with each other.  Thank you Team!!!
