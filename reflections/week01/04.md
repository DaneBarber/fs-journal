## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? for conceptually laying out the design of your website.  More can be filled in later. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
-low: essentially just blocks of general layout
-medium fidelity: more refined, some colors and layout but looks more like a finished product
-hight fidelity: a more polished product which would give the viewer/designer a good idea of what the final product should be including colors, design elements, including some images and such.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not? They are absolutely worth all of that as that effort will not be a distraction at the time of building the final product as the vision of what is to be is already done, there is no guesswork.
