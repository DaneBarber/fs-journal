# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? The teamwork on the Hackathon was great for internal networking
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise? - More planning would have been beneficial, there are always those things which creep up, but many of them could be identified through just critical thinking.
- What are you struggling with?  - During the hackathon, the starting and stopping from one part of the project took some getting used to.
- What would you count as a victory? - the team working together, when there was a disagreement, we took the time to listen to the differing perspectives.
